Tracking is closing the distance with the ball carrier maintains the leverage.
As we approach making contact we key the near hip of the ball carrier.

### Drill: Run and Gather

*Roles*:

- One ball carrier - BC

- Coach - C

*Description*:

1. BC and T are separated for 10-15 yd.
2. BC moving towards one direction parallel with the T. He is changing speed, but no direction.
3. T follow BC to the point of tackle

*Coaching point*:

- Follow the near hip
- Change footwork depending on BC; use shuffle, lateral, sprint
- Low body level ready to engage the BC
- Eyes through the thighs

### Strike Zone

Strike zone is the area between knees and numbers, much like is baseball strike
zone. To make sure it's going to be great tackle, eliminate helmet from the
tackling and attack with shoulder.
